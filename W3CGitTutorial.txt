gh pr create    # Create a pull request
When the current branch isn't fully pushed to a git remote, a prompt will ask
where to push the branch and offer an option to fork the base repository.
Use --head to explicitly skip any forking or pushing behavior.

--fill to autofill these values from git commits.

Link an issue to the pull request by referencing the issue in the body of the pull request.
If the body text mentions Fixes #123 or Closes #123, the referenced issue will automatically get closed when the pull request gets merged.

By default, users with write access to the base repository can push new commits to the head branch of the pull request.
Disable this with --no-maintainer-edit.

////////////////////////////////////////
It is used for:
    Tracking code changes
    Tracking who made changes

What does Git do?
    Manage projects with Repositories
    Clone a project to work on a local copy
    Control and track changes with Staging and Committing
    Branch and Merge to allow for work on different parts and versions of a project
    Pull the latest version of the project to a local copy
    Push local updates to the main project

Working with Git
    Initialize Git on a folder, making it a Repository
    Git now creates a hidden folder to keep track of changes in that folder
    When a file is changed, added or deleted, it is considered modified
    You select the modified files you want to Stage
    The Staged files are Committed, which prompts Git to store a permanent snapshot of the files
    Git allows you to see the full history of every commit.
    You can revert back to any previous commit.
    Git does not store a separate copy of every file in every commit, but keeps track of changes made in each commit!
