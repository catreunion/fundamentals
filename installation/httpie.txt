Basic HTTPie Usage

Send a HTTP Method

You can send a HTTP method in the request, for example, we will send the GET method which is used to request data from a specified resource. Note that the name of the HTTP method comes right before the URL argument.

$ http GET tecmint.lan

Upload a File
$ http https://transfer.sh < file.txt

Download a File
$ http https://transfer.sh/Vq3Kg/file.txt > file.txt		#using output redirection
OR
$ http --download https://transfer.sh/Vq3Kg/file.txt  	        #using wget format

Submit a Form
$ http --form POST tecmint.lan date='Hello World'

View Request Details
To see the request that is being sent, use -v option, for example.
$ http -v --form POST tecmint.lan date='Hello World'

Basic HTTP Auth
$ http -a username:password http://tecmint.lan/admin/

Custom HTTP Headers
You can also define custom HTTP headers in using the Header:Value notation. We can test this using the following URL, which returns headers. Here, we have defined a custom User-Agent called ‘strong>TEST 1.0’:

$ http GET https://httpbin.org/headers User-Agent:'TEST 1.0'
